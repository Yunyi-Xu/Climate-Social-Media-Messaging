Thank you as always to the incredible number of users we have that enrich the science content posted here every day. 

In an effort to continue our work towards always improving the quality of the subreddit without excluding users that don't have science degrees, we have made a few tweaks and clarifications to our commenting rules. I'll post them in full below for anyone who would like to read them and ask questions. The changes are mostly minor but it's a good chance to post them in full anyway.

When reading the rules, please keep in mind that our overarching aim is to provide high level science communication, within an algorithm designed to reward easy/jokey content and quick momentum. These rules are intended to promote high quality questions and insights.

Thank you for taking the time to read it and please always feel free to contact the mod team about ways we can improve the subreddit.
---

1. No off-topic comments, memes, low-effort comments or jokes
Comments must be on topic and not a meme or joke. Comments should constructively contribute to the discussion or be an attempt to learn more. This also means avoiding low-effort comments like “water is wet” or “correlation doesn’t prove causation”.
While this may seem anti-fun, our aim is to provide high quality science communication. Jokes and memes will always be “easier” content than insightful and well-researched comments. By removing them, we provide a greater opportunity for high-quality comments to rise to the top.
2. No abusive or offensive comments
Abusive comments include those that disparage or attack other users of the subreddit. If you believe another user is acting inappropriately, please report the comment or send us a modmail. Abusing other users will not be tolerated.  
Offensive comments are those that denigrate individuals or groups based on group membership or inherent characteristics. This includes bigoted comments that are thinly veiled by leading/insincere questions or “just stating facts”.
Comments discussing the implications of group behavior are allowed but only with the appropriate context and nuance. For example, “All creationists are idiots” would be removed while “Political pressure to remove evolution from school books affects education” would be allowed.     
Repeat or malicious offenders will be banned.
3. No personal anecdotes
Comments that only rely on a user's non-professional anecdotal evidence to confirm or refute a study will be removed (e.g. ""I do that but that result doesn't happen to me""). Comments should be limited in personal details and scientific in nature. Including references to peer-reviewed research to support your claims is highly encouraged.
4. Criticism of published work should assume basic competence of the researchers and reviewers
If your first thought when reading the title of an article is “they didn’t think about [x]”, it’s fair to assume that they probably did. If they didn’t, the reviewers almost certainly did. Even if they did not, you are unlikely to entirely disprove a study based on that one confound.
Please also remember that individual studies sit within a larger corpus of work that may have already addressed your concern. “Why did they study X and not Y?” will probably be answered by several studies on Y. “Their study assumes that X leads to Y” might already be well established.
Critiquing science is an important skill and one we want users to engage in but please try to do so with the assumption that the researchers who have spent years or decades in the field have already considered ideas that you came up with in a few minutes.
5. Comments dismissing established findings and fields of science must provide evidence
Comments that dispute well-established scientific concepts (e.g. gravity, vaccination, anthropogenic climate change, etc.) must be supported with appropriate peer-reviewed evidence. Links to personal blogs or 'skeptic' websites are not valid forms of evidence.
Similarly, comments that dismiss entire fields of science (e.g., “that’s just a soft science"") will also be removed.
Comments that are overtly fringe and/or unsubstantiated will be removed and may lead to a ban.
6. No medical advice
Offering or seeking medical advice is strictly prohibited and offending comments will be removed. Discussions regarding the advantages and/or disadvantages of certain treatments, diets, or supplements is allowed as long as relevant and reputable evidence is provided.
7. Repeat or flagrant offenders will be banned
Users that frequently or flagrantly violate the comment rules will be banned."

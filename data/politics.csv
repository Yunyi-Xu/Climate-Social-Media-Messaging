Harris | 01/20/2021 - Live 11:00 AM ET | Part II,PoliticsModeratorBot,politics,7182262,29278,1.0,"Joseph R. Biden and Kamala D. Harris will take the Oath of Office today, becoming the 46th President and Vice President of the United States of America.

Today's inauguration is unprecedented, for a number of reasons. Among them, Kamala Harris will become the first woman to serve as Vice President. Meanwhile, the ceremony itself will look markedly different, with limited audience due to COVID-19 restrictions, and a drastically increased security presence in response to concerns as a result of the insurrection at the Capitol on 1/6/2021.

Incoming President Biden’s Inauguration speech is expected to be 20-30 minutes long with a focus on unity and a need to bring the county together. Widespread reports are that the Biden Administration has already laid out ambitious plans to overhaul immigration policy, address Climate Change, combat COVID-19 and provide economic relief to those affected by the pandemic during their first 100 days in office.

308,n0sg1r,Discussion Thread: President Biden Addresses a Joint Session of Congress - 04/28/2021 | Live - 9:00 PM ET,PoliticsModeratorBot,politics,7499816,5,1.0,"President Biden delivers his first address to a [Joint Session of Congress.](https://www.c-span.org/video/?511121-1/president-biden-addresses-joint-session-congress&amp;live)

Tonight’s address comes on the eve of President Biden’s 100th day in office, which is later than these addresses are traditionally given. This, however, allows President Biden to have a larger pool of experience to speak of, with several early key victories and accomplishments for this administration to be a focus of the address. 

Several other changes will be evident, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Attendance will be limited to 200, with few special guests. Notable attendees include: First Lady Dr. Jill Biden. Vice President Kamala Harris and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff. Chief Justice John Roberts, with no other justices in attendance. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken are expected to be the only Cabinet members to attend. Selected members from each party of the Senate and House of Representatives will attend. President Biden will make the traditional entrance and walk down the aisle, but will do so masked, and will speak before an entirely masked audience. Interestingly, due to the small scale of tonight’s Joint Session, it was decided that there will be no designated survivor in place. 

Perhaps most notably, tonight will be the first time in history that this address will be delivered with two women appearing with the President. Vice President Kamala Harris and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi will be seated behind President Biden during his address to Congress

Expected topics for tonight’s address may include, but are not limited to: 

* Coronavirus response and relief
* Climate change
* Immigration and the southern border
* The American Families Plan
* Infrastructure 
* and much more

Afterwards, Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) [will deliver the Republican response](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/22/989993117/republican-sen-tim-scott-will-deliver-gop-response-to-biden-address), which is expected to be directed at “working Americans.”

While I wind up covering everything from the presidential campaign trail to back-room Congressional deals to states’ voting rights battles, I really like to nerd out with campaign finance filings.  

I can save you one AMA question…What’s NBCLX?  Well, it’s NBC’s new(ish) [national news network](https://www.lx.com/where-to-watch/) focused on in-depth explanatory journalism that cuts through the partisan hyperbole. 
 
Today’s AMA is about the surprisingly significant shifts Republicans have made to addressing climate change thanks, in part, to pressure from young conservatives. However, a lot of Republicans in Congress don’t want to answer questions about it. Many just ghosted me.

On Sunday, cloture was invoked on the Bipartisan Infrastructure package, which limits further debate in the Senate to 30 hours. This time expired at 3:50AM and Senators are expected to vote on final passage of the bill this morning, where a simple majority will suffice to pass legislation through the chamber. An 11th hour discussion between a bipartisan group of Senators to add an amendment to the bill which would have revised language in the bill that imposed additional reporting requirements on cryptocurrency transactions that the industry considered harmful  [failed to obtain unanimous consent](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/09/senators-make-deal-on-crypto-amendment-treasury-wont-oppose-it.html).

Following the vote on the Bipartisan Infrastructure package, the Senate is expected to begin the reconciliation process for another [Infrastructure package](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/09/politics/read-senate-resolution-fiscal-year-2022/index.html), currently priced at an estimated $3.5 trillion over a decade, and set to include a number of [human infrastructure and climate change initiatives](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/MEMORANDUM%20for%20Democratic%20Senators%20-%20FY2022%20Budget%20Resolution.pdf). Under reconciliation rules in the Senate, Senators are not permitted to filibuster the legislation, but significant limitations exist on the kinds of legislation appropriate for this procedure - namely, that any proposed legislation be primarily and not merely incidentally budgetary.

This reconciliation process, which occurred earlier this year for the American Rescue Plan, begins with a vote on a budget resolution, which instructs committees of jurisdiction to appropriate funds  pursuant the amount they are allotted. To hold a final vote, however, Senators must first go through 20 hours of debate. Following debate, any roll call amendments that remain will get voted on in rapid succession without discussion in what’s colloquially known as the “vote-a-rama”. After this, the Senate will vote on the budget resolution, which is expected to fall under entirely partisan lines. Lawmakers under the resolution will have until September 15 to draft legislation, at which time the bill will move to a vote.

The vote comes in the wake of a vote earlier this month on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework, which was a bill that passed by a wide bipartisan margin in the Senate (including the vote of GOP Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell) and with a dozen or so House Republicans backing it as well.

Moderate Democrats in the House had declined to vote for BBB until the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) completed its assessment on the expected cost of the bill. Citing inflation concerns, moderate Democrats such as Oregon Congressman Kurt Schrader and New Jersey Congressman Josh Gottheimer made a push to ensure that the bill would not add to the deficit over its 10 year period. CBO announced earlier this morning that its assessment would be completed later this afternoon, at which point Democrats expect to begin the process of voting on the bill. Unlike the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework, BBB is not expected to attract any Republican votes, meaning Democrats, who hold the House by a narrow 221-213 margin (one vacancy), cannot afford to suffer many defections, and will require the support of all wings of the party to pass the bill.

From there, the bill will head to the Senate, which is expected to continue the process. BBB was passed under reconciliation instructions, meaning that certain pieces of the legislation, particularly immigration reform, may be further removed from the final bill that passes the upper chamber. Democrats cannot afford defections at all in the Senate, which they hold by virtue of Vice President Harris’ tiebreaking vote, and negotiations are still under way with centrist members of the Democratic caucus in the Senate to secure support, particularly from West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, and Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema.

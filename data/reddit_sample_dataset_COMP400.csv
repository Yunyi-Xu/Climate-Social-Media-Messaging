I know this a rather unconventional approach to convincing you guys, but you don't listen to any other approach so lets see if this one works. Every major center of climate change activists is in an industrialized country, which has an economy running on the burning of fossil fuels. Activists, governments, and the average person would have nothing to gain by working for a greener future only to reinforce a ""hoax."" The only rational and logical explanation why most people acknowledge and try to hinder the affects of climate change is that there is overwhelming and indisputable evidence that climate change is happening.

The affects of climate change be seen right now, including rising sea levels. First, rising sea levels can be seen in the Marshall islands, with several of the islands being submerged by 2035, likely even earlier. Second, the polar winds are weakening, which means rain which was supposed to be spread over an entire region is instead dropped on a single area. The best example of this is the recent 100-year-flood of the Rhine which mainly effected Germany, but also France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland and the Netherlands  with the death toll having risen above 100 people. However, there was also recent European  flooding in Austria, Italy, The UK, Croatia, The Czech Republic, and Romania. Not to mention the widley reported flooding in China. Third are the wildfires, which I don't need to talk about because with the exception of Greece, the wildfires were generally widely reported in the US."
442,qc7ekr,How do I deal with anger? (Warning: This is really long),AnOtakuLynx,teenagers,2647738,5,1.0,"Since the start of 8th grade (I’m a sophomore in High School now) I’ve been getting angry for little things or just being in an angry mood on some days. Today is one of those days. I’m mad at everything. Friends that fake depression for attention. They are a part of my friend group and I don’t want to call them out in front of the group. I don’t want them to hate me. I’m mad at the school system. I don’t want to end my nights before I go to sleep dreading to wake up to go to school the next day. And a multitude of other reasons that could be an entire post unto itself. I’m mad at the world. I had to do a current event report and I decided, against my better judgement, to do it about a recent study in global warming and fossil fuels. That is today. I’m just angry at everything and I don’t know how to deal with it. I’ve been playing (this is gonna sound cringe but this is a trust circle) VR games like Blade and Sorcery and Thrill of the Fight to have an outlet for some of my anger. But it hasn’t been helping. I listen to intense music like System of a Down and Slipknot to get some anger out, and I play those songs on guitar, which is another outlet. But lately, it hasn’t been helping. For weeks I’ve wanted somebody to want to fight me just to have some sort of excitement in my life. But then I remember I’m a fucking 5’ 4” 105lbs weakling. What the hell am I going to do about anything? I want to change the system, but how am I supposed to do that? I’m just a student. I need advice from fellow teens. 

TLDR: I’m angry at everything and want it to stop/subside a little"
108,mnnttp,Would the world be a brighter and happier place if every human could have a middle class lifestyle and go to Disney World and other expensive vacations every year without making climate change worse?,FullBandPixy,teenagers,2445875,4,1.0,"I heard the 90s were a brighter and happier time? Why? Less inequality? News networks less interested in bombarding us with depressing news? 

If biofuel or whatever tech Bill Gates or Elon Musk is working on made jet flight zero or less carbon emissions and that allowed more humans to take vacations would the world be a better place?

I heard people were more excited by space exploration in the 90s. Sci fi shows like ""The X-Files"", ""Babylon 5"", ""Farscape"", and ""Star Trek"" were common on TV.

Would a happier more optimistic society be more interested in exploring space?"

I've just come off a panel that was meant to be about my countries climate action plan for next year and it was God awful. I could go into all the details about how the plan itself was stupid and wouldn't make a shred of difference in the grand scheme of things but I'm too emotionally drained and I'm sure anyone reading this had heard it all before. Sometimes I hate myself for trying to be an activist in this field cause I have to face the fact that my entire generations lives are on the line and everyone is just brushing it off like it's nothing. 

I tried to talk about it with my dad and he just went on about how people are greedy and awful and he just dosent know how to change it, how the challenge is too great, how he dosent know how we can change the rich or the economy how he, he, him, him all about him. It could just be me but I hear far too many older people talking about how they don't know how to make a difference and all that well what about me, what about you? What about our friends? What about how I wanted children but now would feel guilty to bring them into this world, just like so many other people. What about the fact that the people who are going to be affected first and are currently affected now aren't heard because we're too selfish to share our wealth. 

Does anyone else feel this overwhelming sense of dread sometimes when we should be looking forward to our futures? How do you deal with it? It's like pandora's box, now it's opened I can't close it and I wish I could. I wish I could just pretend it isn't that bad and things are going to be okay. I'm so scared for our future, we have to optimistic cause if we aren't we've given up but it's so hard when it feels like no one in power cares and are perfectly fine leaving us with a world that they destroyed. I feel like I need to do something but I'm so weak in comparison to those in power. Does anyone else even slightly relate? 

If you happen to know a r/ where I could talk to other people about this I'd appreciate it as well, I couldn't find really any communities where I could discuss this. They seemed very fact focused and my post would probably just get taken down."

244,ojlty4,I sincerely wish that Throawaylien's supposed prediction that July 18th being the day when aliens shows up here is right so that the world can finally change for the better!,IntrepidFee3198,teenagers,2547756,9,1.0,"Eight years ago a random user /u/throawaylien put up [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1r034d/alien_abductees_of_reddit_or_people_who_have/cdikpd2/) at AskReddit saying that he was abducted by aliens by a lot since he was a kid and that they supposedly told him that they will come to Earth and show themselves on this July 18th.

Throawaylien does not know really much about their motive and he deleted his account shortly afterwards, but that doesn't stop the anticipation from ballooning up in the past few days.

Now I understand that there is the likelihood of his posts being a LARP, besides of that of being a prediction. There is also the distinct possibility of it turning to be true because it happened that [there is a post about the tic-tac UFO/UAP incident on a navy carrier years before they confirmed it](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1qyu5i/my_ufo_encounterexposure_while_on_board_an/). But I don't just sit around and believe it will happen; I want it to happen by a lot 3000%, even to the point that I'll do it if there is a good way to make it happen.

Ever since the time of graduating from high school several years ago it's as if the world is been spirally downward like how satellites in very low orbits getting bogged down by atmospheric drag in terms of altitude. I feel that something has to be done so most of the time I did things like hacking computers to pursue certain political goals; this actually got me featured on some news articles on few occasions.

I tried, I fought, but it's just keep getting worse and worse. The country I'm living in now has a shameful and illegit backdoor government starting from last year. Had it not for them we won't be suffering the horrors of high daily cases and casualties everyday. Again because of them, most of my life plans have been thrown into chaos.

As of now we had crossed the 10,000 daily case mark standing at 11,079 following a big jump. People are now flying white flags for help which in the very past I thought was a symbol of surrender and cowardice. I can't go into bookstores just to chill on weekends; rather I'd been forced to find solace by playing Roblox or watching videos.

As I said, I want aliens to come over here on Earth this 18th, and all over the time I've did things ranging from using online radio transmitters to perform METI (message for extraterrestrial intelligence), to exotic/psychic methods such as Steven Greer's CE5 protocol. For the latter I did mostly indoors, but recently I did part of it outdoors.

If aliens come, I want to be the central part of it, by putting a human face on the ET intervention mission. This means I take charge most aspects of their operations on Earth, like what they do or when to leave. I don't really give a fuck on being called a Quisling for this, because it's just the tenet of by all means necessary when things are getting too hard these days. If you can't push it, you're not using the force enough for it.

In an Isaac Arthur video about aliens, he said that a large enough space civilisation, performing an intervention like that would just be like funding a war memorial for us, and hence it won't be necessary that an entire civilisation is involved in the effort; just a small pro-uplifting group is enough.

Assuming that they do not just limit themselves to 'humanitarian' part of the mission and permits extension into 'political', and if they have some fancy superweapons far beyond than what we can comprehend, I would want to use the power to force some big nations to back down from wars and diplomatic crises and to put in some peace plans that hadn't been factored in yet so far owing to narrow visions that comes with all types of names such as 'conventional', 'realism', or 'pragmatist'. Unlike other circles like tech, innovations are dumbed down and rote methods are the norm. Steve Jobs or Elon Musk would just stay ordinary like that had they started out in politics rather than tech.

Besides that I would want to use the occasion to make great strides to the pandemic relief efforts, such as providing logistical supports like making those large scale freighter ships that can land on surface into temporary hospitals, using factory ships to make as many respirators as possible, and test whether undiscovered new drugs such as DRACO or those based on gene-editing technologies like CRISPR can work against the virus or not.

I know there is a limit to such an operation though because it doesn't really work if the populace drags in the same spot despite given the chance to move forward. See Afghanistan for example where 20 years of wasting bloods, sweats and golds has brought us nothing. I don't think most of the people would want to move forward to combat climate change either so I would want to pull a Laconia by backing up gigantic troves of human knowledge into ships that would sail into the expanse once the operation is over so that our legacy can continue to shine amongst the cosmos even after we doom ourselves into sheer fuckery in terms of climate change.


If it happens of course I'd like my corrupt backdoor government to be traumatised by the numbers 718, just like how they did to my community with 513. This nutjob illegit backdoor government has done nothing good but pushing us to surpass countries like Japan in terms of total case rankings. By current trends I fear that we would become top 10 by the end of the year, so enough is enough, I want throwawaylien's prediction about aliens coming over in July 18 (or affectionately referred as the Aitee) to become true so that the sufferings and nonsenses can stop and the world finally returns to a better state.

The 90's and probably the early 10's were the calmer times that I hoped to return with it. Even though better never means better for everyone and that it always means worse for some, it's all fine if those receive the worse end of it are those luddite-inclining nihilists or misanthropists who caused so many of the problems these days like the Pooh, starting from when I graduated from high school."

As long as you are different from someone, someone will have the chance to discriminate against you, and try to fuck up your day because they had a bad one.

As long as humanity exists, someone will get angry, and take it out on another person who is different from them, therefore causing a racist incident, or homophobic incident, or whatever the situation calls for.

I would say just try not to let them get a rise out of you when someone discriminates against you, but lets be honest here, that *never* fucking works\*.\* The very nature of emotions prohibits you from thinking properly, and by the time you're done crying because you were hurt, or yelling because you were angry, they would have already gotten what they wanted.

Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah!

Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.

Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone.     You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp.     - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...     Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming.     Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money. ""They make the honey, and we make the money""? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop. I remember that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Ohung. - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Ohung. A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this""? Bees have never been afraid to change the world. What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century. You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. It's a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. - Hello. - Hello, bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working. But it's our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. - Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial flowers. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty! It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Barry? It's pretty big, isn't it? I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day. You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn't the bee team. You boys work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Oase number 4475, Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world? I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?     They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!     Oall your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms. Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term. I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you? - No. - I couldn't hear you. - No. - No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean like this? Bears kill bees! How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police. But you've never been a police officer, have you? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That's not his real name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow. I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella! Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Well, here's to a great team. To a great team!     Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There's a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby. That's where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see what you're doing? I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common. Do we? Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right. I'm going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know, I've just about had it with your little mind games. - What's that? - Italian Vogue. Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages. A lot of ads. Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here! I love the smell of flowers. How do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much. Water bug! Not taking sides! Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic! I've got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! - You're bluffing. - Am I? Surf's up, dude! Poo water! That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it! We need to talk! He's just a little bee! And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them! Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster! Goodbye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man! I'm sorry about all that. I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well. Are you OK for the trial? I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers... Yeah. Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over. Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees. - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic? Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends. - Good friends? - Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little...     ...bedbug? I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children? - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents! - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are! Hold me back! You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson? He's denouncing bees! Don't y'all date your cousins? - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way! - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs. What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. - Is there much pain? - Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn't I? It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What will the humans do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam, they check in, but they don't check out! Oh, my. Oould you get a nurse to close that window? - Why? - The smoke. Bees don't smoke. Right. Bees don't smoke. Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking. That's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.     Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. I actually heard a funny story about... Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion. But you can't! We have a terrific case. Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's a bee smoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee. Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?"" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! The court finds in favor of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry. I'm OK! You know what this means? All the honey will finally belong to the bees. Now we won't have to work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson. You'll regret this. Barry, how much honey is out there? All right. One at a time. Barry, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean? We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years. Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement? First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more     than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine. We're all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine. And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames... But it's just a prance-about stage name! ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments. Oan't breathe. Bring it in, boys! Hold it right there! Good. Tap it. Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming! - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down. Shut down honey production! Stop making honey! Turn your key, sir! What do we do now? Oannonball! We're shutting honey production! Mission abort. Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base. Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there. Oh, yeah? What's going on? Where is everybody? - Are they out celebrating? - They're home. They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in. I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket. At least we got our honey back. Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't? It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it. This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now... Now I can't. I don't understand why they're not happy. I thought their lives would be better! They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people. You don't have any idea what's going on, do you?     - What did you want to show me? - This. What happened here? That is not the half of it. Oh, no. Oh, my. They're all wilting. Doesn't look very good, does it? No."

 And of course the fire was the fault of a greedy corporation and shitty idealist California laws, that forbid PG&amp;E from logging by the power lines.

The scientific stuff they do is still important.

Hopefully the X-57 will lead to better batteries for electric cars and even better solar panels. These will aide us in our fight against climate change.

Hopefully the Jim Webb telescope will give us a better understanding of how the universe was formed.

But during the last decade NASA has wasted 20 billion cobbling up a rocket that is recycled from old technology from the space shuttle as well as spending another 12 billion for an Apollo styled spacecraft.

Meanwhile a true heir to the space shuttle is being developed for much less.

411,pzx6e7,Did 2020 change you as much as it did me?,Pathfinder183,teenagers,2626280,5,1.0,"I remember when I was in 5th grade in 2014 I became intensely interested in space and science thanks to a game called ""Kerbal Space Program"" and an astrophysicist becoming popular on social media named ""Neil Degrasse Tyson"". Movies like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", ""Interstellar"", and ""Big Hero 6"" added fuel to that fire.

During the Summer between 7th and 8th grade in 2017 a friend invented me over and showed me a video game called ""Mass Effect"" and I was blown away by the universe, story, and characters that was created in this video game. As a ""Cod bro type gamer"" I also never seen a video game quite like it before. Role playing combined with cinematic storytelling. That blew me away as well.

But sadly I lost interest in those things by 2018 during the summer before my sophomore year of high school. That year my family finally saved enough money for a trip to Disney World. During my high school years I was excited to get into the college frat culture. I thought athletes were the coolest people ever. I wanted to major in business to get a cushy office job that would pay enough for nice vacations each year. If that wasn't bad enough I became obsessed with organic food because that is what the rich good looking people were eating and hell I even became an anti vaxxer for a short while. During the short time period I became convinced that ""GMOS"" and ""Vaccines"" were causing Americans to become obese. I even didn't know SpaceX had reusable rockets.

Fast forward to 2020 during 11th grade COVID hits and during the quarantine I check out this alternate history soap opera on Apple TV called ""For All Mankind"" and it reignites my interest in space which in turn leads to a greater appreciation for science.

After finishing the first season I binged watch any movie or show about astronauts I could find. I watched ""Apollo 13"", ""First Man"", ""The Right Stuff"", ""Hidden Figures"", ""The Martian"", ""Interstellar"", and even a Russian movie called ""Salyut 7"" as well as an anime called ""Planetes"".

I now think being an astronaut would be the coolest thing ever.

2020 really opened my eyes.

Now I am in my last year of high school and I don't care about BMWs or fancy vacations anymore. I want to go into science or engineering. I want to save the world from climate change. I want to push space travel forward.

I now think the world would be a better place if we were inspired by the astronauts instead of professional athletes and reality show stars.

I look back and I can't believe I became so vapid. I am horrified by how anti intellectual society became. I look back at the 2010s as a vapid and crazy time. I look back at the 2010s as a decade where humanity gave in to it's worst urges. Gay marriage was a win though.

If the 2010s were the worst of humanity then I hope that the 2020s will be a turning point. A decade where humanity retakes it's future.

And then basically once we can all stop isolating, then we'll be hit with horrible natural disasters and global crises from global warming.
